## This readme will go over the basics of getting around Mac, Atom and Git. I have suggestions at the bottom as well.

## The bottom line is, if you see someone doing something that looks like a shortcut, ask them what it is! It's far easier to learn these things when you need them gradually than trying to memorise a list.

## Finally, knowing shortcuts is useful and can feel productive, but it's not a substitute for learning to code. Use them and GET CODING! <3

Please keep in mind that these are just my opinion - you don't have to use what I use!


## Mac
`⌘ + C` copy selected text

`⌘ + V` paste selected text

`⌘ + X` cut selected text (this means it will be deleted AND copied to the clipboard)

`⌘ + Z` undo last action

`⌘ + Y` redo last action (sometimes ⌘ + SHIFT + Z)

`⌘ + F` find on page

`⌘ + TAB` Scroll through your applications

`⌘ + SHIFT + TAB` Scroll backwards through your applications

`⌘ + `` Scroll through "instances" (get it?) of the same application

`⌘ + W` close this window

`⌘ + Q` close this application

Fullscreen on mac - alternatively hold down maximise (green) to create split screen

Mac gestures - eg three fingers up

## Chrome:
`⌘ + L` select the browser bar

`⌘ + T` open a new tab

`⌘ + W` close a tab

`⌘ + SHIFT + T` reopen the tab you just closed

`⌘ + ->` go forward a page

`⌘ + <-` go back a page

`⌘ + <num>` tab number

`⌘ + <arrow>` go to end or start of line

`OPTION + SHIFT + <arrow>` select word by word



## Atom Text Editor

`⌘ + D` select the next matching item as the one you have currently selected

`⌘ + L` select entire line

`⌘ + SHIFT + D` duplicated entire line

`⌘ + F` find in the current pane

`⌘ + SHIFT + F` find in the entire open directory

`⌘ + /` toggle comment on the entire line

`CRTL + A` jump to the beginning of a line

`TAB` indent right

`TAB + SHIFT` indent left

`A` make new file

`SHIFT + A` make new folder

`⌘ + CTRL + UP/DOWN` move the entire line up/down

`⌘ + DELETE` deletes entire line

`⌘ + X` cuts entire line (if there is no selection)

## Terminal / iTerm

`TAB` autocompletes text currently being typed

`mdfind <search_term_string>` searches and returns things containing that string; like spotlight in the terminal https://ss64.com/osx/mdfind.html

`⌘ + T` new tab

`⌘ + N` new window

`⌘ + D` split pane 


## Other suggestions
Spectacle for window layout - be aware this will overwrite some other shortcuts
